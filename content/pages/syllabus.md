## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Description

This course covers the concepts and physical pictures behind various phenomena that appear in interacting quantum many-body systems. Key ideas/techniques to be covered include broken symmetry, effective field theories, functional integral methods, and quantum phase transition theory.

A rough syllabus is:

- Second quantization; path integrals in quantum mechanics
- Interacting bosons - superfluidity
- Broken symmetry and its consequences
- Low dimensional quantum magnetism

## Prerequisites

Quantum Physics II ([8.05](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013)), Statistical Physics II ([8.08](/courses/8-08-statistical-physics-ii-spring-2005)), Relativity ([8.033](/courses/8-033-relativity-fall-2006)) or Classical Mechanics II (8.21), Physics of Solids I ([8.231](/courses/8-231-physics-of-solids-i-fall-2006))

## Homework

There will typically be one homework every week which will be due on the same day of the following week. Late homework is strongly discouraged!!

## Presentation

There will be no final exam - instead there will be a short in-class presentation on a topic of general interest to the material in the course. Specific recommendations for presentation topics will be provided later.

## Books

No single textbook will be used. What follows is a list of books that I find useful. When appropriate, lecture notes or references to review articles/research papers will be provided.
